	Ok, here's a rundown of the idea I went with for this error system:
		We have an error enum with defferent categories of errors: OK, PARAM, INTERNAL, FATAL, and WARN.
		An error AND'd with it's error category will result in true and fail otherwise, allowing you to
			identify groups of errors and act accordingly
		You shouldn't actually set the errno to a category unless it's BS_OK, you should use the
			subcategory errors
		BS_OK is pretty self-explanitory
		BS_PARAM indicated a parameter error. I also, somewhat arguably incorrectly, also use it to
			indicate an error with the BS object, though that may technically be INTERNAL/FATAL
		BS_INTERNAL indicates some sort of issue with the BS object itself, but it's not a fatal issue
			For example, you wanted a block, but we're out. The object's not broken, but it is an error.
		BS_FATAL Originally was supposed to indicate that the BS object was left in a broken state, but
			it turned out that due to the way I organized things, the object can only break during
			creation, and if that happens, it's not returned, so now it indicated that the operation failed
			for some reason (like a malloc failure). Since I have both FILE_ACCESS and FILE_IO, let me explain
			FILE_ACCESS is for when you, well, can't access the file. FILE_IO is for an error during file IO
			(which is a much bigger problem, if this is during export, the file might be broken, and if it's
			dirng import, import fails)
		BS_WARN is really just covering an edge case I decided to allow
			BS_REQUEST_MISMATCH is set when you read/write to a block not marked as in use
			The read/write functions still return normally, but the errno isn't BS_OK.
			Warning are meant to be just that, only a warning
	Be sure to return the appropriate error category when a problem happens!
